## Implementation Instructions

This assignment focuses on working with web APIs and HTTP requests through two practical tasks.

**Task 1** involves using **curl** commands in bash scripts to perform CRUD operations (POST, PATCH, GET, DELETE) against a local Node.js server, practicing API documentation reading and command-line HTTP requests.

**Task 2** requires completing a Nobel Prizes web application by implementing URL construction logic in `services.js` to fetch data from the NobelPrize API with filtering, pagination, and sorting capabilities.

For detailed instructions, see the README in each task folder:

- [Task 1 — curl commands](task-1/README.md)
- [Task 2 — Nobel Prizes Web App](task-2/README.md)
