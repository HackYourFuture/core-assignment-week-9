## Implementation Instructions

This assignment focuses on working with web APIs and HTTP requests through two practical tasks.

**Task 1** involves using **curl** commands in bash scripts to perform CRUD operations (POST, PATCH, GET, DELETE) against a local Node.js server, practicing API documentation reading and command-line HTTP requests.

**Task 2** requires completing a Nobel Prizes web application by implementing URL construction logic in `services.js` to fetch data from the NobelPrize API with filtering, pagination, and sorting capabilities.

For detailed instructions, see the full assignment description at the link provided above.
